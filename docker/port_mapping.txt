When we run a server on a specific port inside a container, we can't access it directly from our local machine. This is because the container is an isolated environment, separate from our local machine.

To make the server accessible, we need to expose the container's port to our local machine. We can do this by running the command "docker run -it -p 1025:1025". This command maps the container's port 1025 to port 1025 on our local machine.
command: docker run -it -p [local machine port]:[container port] [image name]


we can also pass enviroment variables in our docker container like this

docker run -it -p [local machine port]:[container port] -e key=value -e key=value [image name]
