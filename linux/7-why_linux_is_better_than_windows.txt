1. Free and Open Source
Linux is free to use and you can see, change, and share the code. There are no costs involved,
unlike Windows.
Example: Ubuntu, a popular Linux version, is free to download, and you can change its features if you know
how to code. Unlike Windows, which requires a paid license, anyone can use and modify Linux without cost.

2. Fast Performance
Linux runs faster and uses fewer computer resources, especially on older or less powerful computers.
Example: On an old laptop that struggles to run Windows 10, installing Linux (like Lubuntu) can make 
it run smoothly again because Linux uses fewer system resources.

3. Strong Security
Linux is more secure than Windows, with fewer viruses and frequent security updates.
Its design makes it harder for hackers to cause harm.
Example: Most viruses are made for Windows. On Linux, it's rare to need antivirus software. 
For example, Debian Linux servers are used in large companies because they are secure and regularly updated.

4. Fully Customizable
You can change almost everything in Linux to suit your needs, from how it looks to how it works.
You have complete control over the system.
Example: You can change the appearance of Linux by choosing desktop environments like GNOME, KDE, or even simpler 
ones like XFCE. For instance, if you don’t like how the start menu looks, you can change it 
however you want—something you can’t do in Windows.

5. Big Support Community
Linux has a large, helpful community where you can get free support, advice, and tutorials online.
Example: If you run into a problem using Linux, there are forums like Ask Ubuntu and Linux.org where
you can find answers or ask for help. The community is very active and ready to assist beginners.

6. Stability
Linux is very stable and doesn’t crash often, making it great for long-term use or servers.
Example: Many web servers use Linux because it rarely crashes. Companies like Google use Linux-based 
systems to keep their services online without issues, even under heavy loads.

7. No Software Restrictions
You can use a wide range of free software without being tied to any company, unlike Windows, where you often need to buy software.
Example: With Linux, you can install software like LibreOffice (free alternative to Microsoft Office) or GIMP
(alternative to Photoshop) without needing to pay for licenses, unlike Windows, where many tools cost money.


8. Better Control
Linux gives you more control over how your system works, allowing you to fix issues easily and customize 
it the way you like.
Example: If something goes wrong on your Linux system, you can access system files directly and fix the problem.
For example, if your Wi-Fi stops working, you can check and fix the settings yourself. Windows hides a lot of
 these options from users.
