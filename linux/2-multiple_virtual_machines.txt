**** Can you have multiple virtual machines in VirtualBox? ****
- Yes! You can create as many virtual machines as you want in VirtualBox, as long as your actual computer
has enough space and memory (RAM) to support them. For example, you could have one VM running Linux and 
another running a different operating system at the same time.
