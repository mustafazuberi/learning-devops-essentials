**** 'Why do we need VirtualBox ? ****
- VirtualBox is like a manager for virtual machines (VMs). It allows you to create','and run virtual
  computers (VMs) on your actual computer.
- We use VMs because they let you try out different operating systems (like Linux) without messing with
  your current setup.'
