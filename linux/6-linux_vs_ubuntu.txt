**** What’s the difference between Linux and Ubuntu? ****

Linux is like the core foundation or framework. It’s the base operating system that everything else is built on. Just like how React JS is a framework for building user interfaces, Linux is the core system on which different "versions" or "distributions" are built.

Ubuntu is one of the many versions (or distributions) of Linux, just like different versions of React exist. So Ubuntu is like a version of Linux that comes packaged with a lot of tools, apps, and a user-friendly interface for beginners.

Example:
Imagine Linux is like a car engine. It’s powerful but not very user-friendly on its own.
Ubuntu (and other distributions) is like the whole car built around that engine. It comes with doors, seats, and a dashboard—making it easier for you to "drive" (use the operating system).
In this analogy:

Linux = Car engine (the core system)
Ubuntu = The full car (the complete package, ready for you to use)
